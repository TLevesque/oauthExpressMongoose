# Weekly assesment 5 (1 hour)

Start with the exercise described in this file. To complete it you can search docs online, but not entire solutions. Of course, you can use Angular-cli. Then answer the questions that you find in "questions.md", without using any external sources.

If you're stuck on something, move on with the rest and come back to it after having completed the other parts.

## Exercise

![example](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5602052/Screenshot.png)

You have to create a new AngularJS 2.0 app. This app has to be the classical ToDo app. Here go the requirements:

- You must use [Bootsrap](https://valor-software.com/ng2-bootstrap/#/)
- The should be able to:
  - Create a new task
  - Complete a task (so its text should look stroked, with a line-through)

## Extra credits

- Add two buttons or a dropdown that lets you switch between 'Uncompleted' and 'Completed' tasks views.
- The task list should be persited on the browser (so when you close the page and open it again it remember all tasks and their state).
